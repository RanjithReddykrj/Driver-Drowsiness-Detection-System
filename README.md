# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System
In this Python project, we have created a drowsy driver alert system that uses sound to alert the driver if they are becoming drowsy
Drowsiness detection is a safety technology that can prevent accidents that are caused by drivers who fell asleep while driving.

The objective of this intermediate Python project is to build a drowsiness detection system that will detect that a personâ€™s eyes are closed for a few seconds.
This system will alert the driver when drowsiness is detected.
